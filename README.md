# echovr2Dspectate (Depracated)
*This program no longer works properly with the current version of EchoVR.*

This python file reads from the EchoVR API to spectate matches.

It can be used as a spectator tool for others to watch along, or as a minimap for streams/videos.
Feel free to change the config file to suit your needs, and if there's something that you'd like to change that isn't in the config file, I can be found on the [Echo Games Discord server](discord.echo.games) with the username @Pteranodog.

Credit to @bust in the EchoVR Discord server for the original program, which can be found [here](https://github.com/qlyoung/echovr-replay/blob/master/replay2d/replay.py).

# USAGE

To run the program as an .exe file, download the .zip file from Releases and double-click the .exe file within it.

**The config file is required and must be in the same directory**
